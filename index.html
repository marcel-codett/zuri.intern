                    <p class="p-style" >  For so long a time i have had basic understanding of web technologies
                        like Html, CSS and javascript and ever since i have been overwhelmed by it.
                        The moment i figured out how to print "Hello World" i have been intrigued by 
                        everything  else i in knew that moment, i could actually change the worldith my 
                        newly found hobbies you know like do something good by good i mean big.
                       So everyday i would stay up all night and day coding, it became a habit i was
                       overfoundly of, anytime moment i could spare am having screentime and trust me it was
                       all the time. But remember how i talked about doing something "Big" Em i Begin
                       to realize that things were getting small like literally everything from the people 
                       i interacted with to where i went to what i did to what i was eating all have been
                       sucked by my screentime(coding) see trust me i am not complaining, i mean i was 
                       fulfuilled and happy but i noticed that all the things i did and created where stucked in the
                       spacetime quantinium of my localhost(http://127.0.0.1:5501/) i felt like i was trapped in a box wanting to 
                       come so bad but could not, it was like i was alone doing what i did and nobody was seeing 
                       or wanted my service. I was trapped with myself. But the aniety and overwhemleness 
                       weakened because i was not handling real life project, i was not handling real time scenairo
                       i didn't understand the outside world of tech and how to apply myself into it. And also i wasn't having
                       any return from my effort and all the resources i was using to learn, and i also had to sutain myself.
                        
                        so fast forward to like Right now a friend of my came in contact with zuri.training and refered me to 
                        there internship when i read through everything i felt the anxiety and overwhelmness surging through
                        me from the inside out. I was boiling for as much screentime as i can get.
                        
                        So What i would Like to Achieve in 8 weeks 
                        well coming into the HNGi8 x I4G work space i have come to relize that i am not actually alone
                        i this game or struggle but there a hell lot of us and  it happy to and relate with co-codetts. Before 
                        i Digress em the first thing i hope to acheive is </p>
                    </div>

                        <div class="goals">
                            <h4 class="h3 h4-style">1. UNDERSTANDING THE BASIC TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR MY TRACK:</h4>
                            <p class="p-style" >So when i started learn programming i really didn't no what i was getting all i knew was that 
                                i loved coding, so i started touching every material to course and e-books i could lay my hands on, you see  at first this was fun
                                but it was time consuming and i was going in circle because didn't have a basic  deal of how to apply my skill in 
                                the field it was needed. But looking at the fact that we have mentor and people who are around and willing
                                at zuri intership program to help out, for me that just soothing. I don't have to learn python today and 
                                because i don't have anything to do, go again to learning java or c++ and all the other languages. This can get you confused.
                                But with the help  good folks and the team i am assured that this 8 weeks would not be a waste</p>

                            <h4 class="h3 h4-style">2. GETTING ENGAGE IN THE REAL WORLD:</h4>
                            <p class="p-style" >I had alot of time learning the basic level of python but due to the fact that i could not do anything with it 
                                in the real world and i had no one to put me through, i just got tried of listening to my instructs Dr. chuck and 
                                Mosh really thing can get boring real quickly. But Just on monday i started a job i don't even know if i could finish 
                                it even has a deadline am so happy for that. And this so engaging am anixous, overwhelmed and happy. 
                                Thanks zuri hopefully i would participate on even strong change and strech my limit.</p>

                            <h4 class="h3 h4-style">3. LEARING LANGUAGES ON THE FLY</h4>
                            <p class="p-style" >I had this setback of getting resource to keep me updated, but with the help of zuri internship i can see a turn around. To get resource on udemy 
                                 somehow cheap depending if you can wait for the discount but with zuri resources are free that nice and i even have alot of people asking to help out if i get stuck or
                                don't know what to do. I even so some guys looking for study buddies, isnt that amazing. So i could learn and still make friend.</p>
                                
                            <h4 class="h3 h4-style">4. EARNING CASH</h4>
                            <p class="p-style" >Come to think of it when i saw zuri was connecting or refering intern to people that need their service, i said to my self that i 
                                want this yeah. But this thought came like are you that good to reach the final stage, but the this quote i saw when i was younger
                                came to mind immediately "when you shoot for the moon don't be scared if you miss because you can hit the stars" Hope i said that right.
                                So i heard devs make good cash, i just want good cash y'all.</p>
                                
                                <h4 class="h3 h4-style">5. MAKING FRIENDS</h4>
                                <p class="p-style" >You see with zuri i entered with the most crowded room filled with developers/designers/devops/digital marketers all this folks that like screentime for africa.
                                    And alot of them are extending a hand of friendship that really nice. Come to think of it with people you can't predict what you can get, from connects to long-term 
                                    freinds to collegues and partners you name it. Trust me i was told that this coding thing is not making me socialize. And people say i am an introvert before.</p>

                                    
                                <h4 class="h3 h4-style">6. IDEAS THAT BRINGS SOLUTION</h4>
                                <p class="p-style" >Looking at guys in the tech industries like paystack, 
                                    telemedinces, facebook and lot of them. They  all came to 
                                    light with one idea that solves alot of problems that people need but don't forget or put aside all those devs and design marketer
                                    that are there working their ass off to see that it all  come to light. They my not necessarly be the frontlines but they to are important.
                                    So in a nutshell all i am saying is that i also want to be part of bring world changing solution to basic problems all around the world. and maybe be as famous as zuck.</p>
